# Install Guide

## Windows

### Install the Polished Map release

1. Download **install.bat** and **polishedmap.exe** from [the latest release](https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map/releases).
2. Hold down Shift, right-click **install.bat**, and click "**Run as administrator**". This will install Polished Map to your account and create a shortcut on your Desktop.
3. Now you can delete the two downloaded files.
4. Double-click **Polished Map** on your Desktop to open it. If you get an error that "msvcrt140.dll is missing", you need to install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) for x86.

### Build Polished Map from source

You will need [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/); the Community edition is free.

If the pre-built release already works for you, you don't have to build it yourself.

1. On GitHub, click the green "**Code**" button and click "**Download ZIP**". This will download **polished-map-master.zip**.
2. Unzip polished-map-master.zip. This will create the **polished-map-master** folder.
3. Navigate to the polished-map-master folder in Explorer.
4. Download fltk-1.3.7-source.tar.bz2 or fltk-1.3.7-source.tar.gz from [**fltk.org**](https://www.fltk.org/software.php) to a new **polished-map-master\lib** subfolder.
5. Extract fltk-1.3.7-source.tar (you may need a program such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)). This will create the lib\**fltk-1.3.7** folder.
6. Open lib\fltk-1.3.7\abi-version.ide in a text editor such as Notepad and replace "`#undef FL_ABI_VERSION`" with "`#define FL_ABI_VERSION 10307`". Save it.
7. Open lib\fltk-1.3.7\ide\VisualC2010\fltk.sln in Visual Studio 2019. (Other versions may or may not work, I haven't tried.)
8. A "Retarget Projects" dialog will open, since fltk.sln was made for Visual Studio 2010. Click OK to upgrade the Windows SDK version and platform toolset.
9. Go to **Build → Batch Build…**, check the projects **fltk**, **fltkimages**, **fltkpng**, **fltkjpeg**, and **fltkzlib** in the Release configuration, and click the **Build** button.
10. Move all the .lib files from lib\fltk-1.3.7\lib\\\*.lib up to lib\\\*.lib.
11. Copy the lib\FL folder up to include\FL.
12. Open ide\polished-map.sln in Visual Studio 2019.
13. If the Solution Configuration dropdown on the toolbar says Debug, set it to **Release**.
14. Go to **Build → Build Solution** or press F7 to build the project. This will create bin\Release\**polishedmap.exe**.
15. Hold down Shift, right-click **install.bat**, and click "**Run as administrator**". This will install Polished Map to your account and create a shortcut on your Desktop.
