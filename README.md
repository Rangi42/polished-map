# Polished Map [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rangi42/polished-map.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rangi42/polished-map)

A map and tileset editor for [pokecrystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal), [pokegold](https://github.com/pret/pokegold), [pokeyellow](https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow), [pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered), and hacks including [Polished Crystal v2](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal/tree/v2.2.0), [Red++ v3](https://github.com/TheFakeMateo/rpp-backup), [Orange](https://github.com/PiaCarrot/pokeorange), [Prism](http://www.pokemonprism.com/), and many more.

Inspired by [crowdmap](https://github.com/yenatch/crowdmap), but implemented with C++ and [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/), and with more functions for graphics editing.

Latest release: [**4.5.4**](https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map/releases/tag/v4.5.4)

Follow the steps in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install the release copy of Polished Map, or the longer instructions to build it yourself from source.

The [example/](example/) directory contains a minimal pokecrystal project with two test maps. **Kanto.180x135.kanto.blk** is a stitch of every Kanto overworld map (they all use the `kanto` tileset). **Johto.235x135.johto.blk** is a stitch of every Johto overworld map; Goldenrod and Azalea use the `johto_modern` tileset, so try switching tilesets with **Edit→Change Tileset…** or by pressing Ctrl+H.

Browse the menu items, toolbar buttons, and Help dialog to learn how to use Polished Map. And don't miss the mouse controls:
